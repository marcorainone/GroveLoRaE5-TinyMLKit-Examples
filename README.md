# README

This repository contains Arduino tutorials and applications that demonstrate the use of the Grove LoRa E5 module with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE microcontroller included in the Tiny Machine Learning Kit.

The tutorials cover the configuration of the LoRa module, data acquisition from sensors, and their transmission via LoRaWAN using The Things Network version 3 (TTN3)
